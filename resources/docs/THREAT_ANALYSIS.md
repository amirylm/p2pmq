# Threat Analysis

In order to create a robust and secure messaging solution for cross network interoperability, the following threats were considered:

### 1. Message Spamming

Attackers flood the network with invalid or malicious messages, consuming bandwidth and degrading network performance.

**Severity:** Very high \
**Impact:** Network congestion, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.

**Mitigation:**

- Require message validation with cryptographic signatures to ensure message authenticity and integrity
- Require message sequence validation, where unrealistic sequences are considered invalid. Use caching, where the key is based on content hashing, so the same message won't exhaust resources

### 2. Message Spamming: Validation Queue Flooding

Attackers can overload the validation queue by sending spam messages at a very high rate. Legitimate messages get dropped, resulting in a denial of service as messages are ignored.

**Severity:** Very high \
**Impact:** Denial of service, message loss.

**Mitigation:**

Implement a circuit breaker before the validation queue that makes informed decisions based on message origin IP and a probabilistic strategy to drop messages. See [gossipsub v1.1: validation-queue-protection](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/red.md#gossipsub-v11-functional-extension-for-validation-queue-protection).


### 3. Censorship Attacks

Malicious nodes selectively block messages to suppress certain information. Countermeasures include redundancy and diversification of message propagation paths.

**Severity:** Very high \
**Impact:** Information suppression, network manipulation.

**Mitigation:**

- Maintain a diverse set of mesh peers to maintain network resilience
- Use redundancy in message propagation paths to counter censorship attacks
- Employ mechanisms to detect and mitigate Sybil nodes, such as peer scoring and validation


### 4. Denial of Service (DoS)

Adversaries flood the network with malicious traffic or connections to disrupt its operation.

**Severity:** High \
**Impact:** Network disruption, resource exhaustion.

**Mitigation:**

Implement rate limiting, connection policies, and adaptive firewall mechanisms to protect against DoS attacks.


### 5. Partition Attacks

Adversaries attempt to partition the network by disrupting communication between mesh peers.

**Severity:** High \
**Impact:** Network fragmentation, reduced communication.

**Mitigation:**

Ensuring a diverse set of well-behaved mesh peers can help prevent this. Implement a robust peer scoring system to detect and disconnect poorly performing or malicious peers. See [gossipsub v1.1: peer scoring](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#peer-scoring).


### 6. Sybil Attacks

Attackers create multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to manipulate the network.

**Severity:** Medium \
**Impact:** Potential network manipulation, disruption.

**Mitigation:**

Relies on the effectiveness of peer discovery mechanisms, including whitelisting which in controlled by the parent node, which should have access to that information.


### 7. Eclipse Attacks

Malicious nodes attempt to control a target node's connections, isolating it from the legitimate peers.

**Severity:** Medium \
**Impact:** Network isolation, potential data manipulation.

**Mitigation:**

Ensure diverse connectivity by utilizing peer discovery methods and continuously change connected peers.


### 8. DHT Pollution: connections

Malicious nodes flood the DHT with malicious entries as part of an eclipse attack.

**Severity:** Medium \
**Impact:** Network isolation.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement DHT security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized writes and ensure data validity
- Regularly check the integrity of DHT data and remove or quarantine polluted entries


### 9. DHT Pollution: storage

Malicious nodes flood the DHT with irrelevant data, potentially disrupting the network's ability to perform efficient content retrieval.

**Severity:** Medium \
**Impact:** Degraded performance in content retrieval, network congestion, resource exhaustion.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement DHT security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized writes and ensure data validity
- Regularly check the integrity of DHT data and remove or quarantine polluted entries
- Implement rate limiting and access controls for DHT writes to mitigate pollution attempts
